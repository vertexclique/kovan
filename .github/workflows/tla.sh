# Model-check every TLA+ model under tla/ with a pinned, checksum-verified
# tla2tools.jar.
#
# The models' own runner does the work: `tla/run_tlc.sh all` discovers every
# family (a directory of tla/ with an EXPECTED.txt), checks each of its
# configurations and exits non-zero unless every result matches what
# EXPECTED.txt says it must be. This script only fetches the tools, verifies
# them and hands them to the runner through TLA2TOOLS, so CI checks the same
# models the same way a local run does, with no second discovery to drift
# from the first. A tree without tla/run_tlc.sh fails: a model-checking job
# that checked nothing is not a pass.
